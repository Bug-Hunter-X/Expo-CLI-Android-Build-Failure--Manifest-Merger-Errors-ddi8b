This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with the error "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugManifest'. > Manifest merger failed with multiple errors, see logs."
The error logs often point to issues with merging different versions of AndroidX libraries or conflicts between dependencies. This is particularly problematic when integrating third-party libraries or using older codebases.
