The solution involves carefully examining your project's `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files to identify conflicting dependencies.

1. **Identify Conflicting Libraries:** Analyze the error logs from the failed build. Look for specific library names mentioned in the error messages. These are the likely candidates for the conflicts.
2. **Check for Duplicate AndroidX Libraries:**  Ensure you are not including different versions of the same AndroidX library (e.g., multiple versions of `androidx.core:core`).
3. **Update Dependencies:** Update your dependencies to their latest versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`. Newer versions often resolve compatibility issues.
4. **Use Dependency Resolution Tools:**  If you're still struggling, tools like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn-check-updates` can help identify outdated dependencies.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes, run `expo prebuild` (to clear build caches), then try building again: `expo build:android`. 
6. **Review your gradle files:**
Check the `build.gradle` files in both the app level and the project level to find any dependency conflicts and remove unnecessary ones.
7. **Resolving specific library version conflicts:** If the conflict relates to a specific library, carefully review its documentation for compatibility guidelines. Sometimes you might need to downgrade or use a specific version to resolve a conflict. 

Example (Illustrative):
Let's say the log indicated a conflict between `react-native-maps` and `@react-native-community/geolocation`.
You'd investigate whether specific versions of these libraries are incompatible, updating, or changing one or the other as needed. 
You would have to check that there are no versions conflicts with the related dependencies in your `build.gradle` files.
